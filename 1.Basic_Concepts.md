## Basic Concepts
------------------
1.[Blockchain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain)

``A blockchain is a growing list of records``

2.[Block](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#Blocks)

``a segment of an open list of data records``

3.[Block Time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#Blocks)

``the average time it takes for the network to generate one extra block in the blockchain``

4.[Block Header](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/block-header-cryptocurrency.asp)

``A block header is used to identify a particular block on an entire blockchain and is hashed repeatedly to create proof of work for mining rewards``

5.[Blockchain Explorer](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Block_chain_browser)

``A Blockchain Explorer is a web application to view and query blocks working as a web browser that is not connected to the internet, like Google Chrome, but to the Blockchain``

6.[Transaction](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Transaction)

``A transaction is a transfer of Bitcoin value that is broadcast to the network and collected into blocks``

``A Bitcoin address is a unique identifier that serves as a virtual location where the cryptocurrency ``

8.[Key](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_(cryptography))

``A key in cryptography is a piece of information, usually a string of numbers or letters that are stored in a file, which, when processed through a cryptographic algorithm, can encode or decode cryptographic data.``

9.[Private Key](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Private_key)

``A private key in the context of Bitcoin is a secret number that allows bitcoins to be spent.``

10.[Public Key](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/definition/public-key)

``a public key is a large numerical value that is used to encrypt data``

16.[Token](https://www.coinbase.com/learn/crypto-basics/what-is-a-token)

``A “token” often refers to any cryptocurrency besides Bitcoin and Ethereum. The other increasingly common meaning for “token” has an even more specific connotation, which is to describe cryptoassets that run on top of another cryptocurrency’s blockchain.``

17.Coin
``A cryptocurrency or digital cash that is independent of any other blockchain or platform. The key feature of a coin is that of a currency, and the term may also be used to describe a cryptocurrency asset that is not a token. ``

18.[Transaction Fees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency#Block_rewards)

``Transaction fees for cryptocurrency depend mainly on the supply of network capacity at the time, versus the demand from the currency holder for a faster transaction``

20.[Miner](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Bitcoin_Miner)

``Bitcoin Miner is a blog focused on sharing news and developments related to mining Bitcoin.``

21.[Mining](https://www.investopedia.com/tech/how-does-bitcoin-mining-work/)

``Mining is a metaphor for introducing new bitcoins into the system because it requires (computational) work. "Mining" is performed using sophisticated hardware that solves an extremely complex computational math problem.``

22.[Mining Pool](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mining_pool)

``a mining pool is the pooling of resources by miners, who share their processing power over a network, to split the reward equally, according to the amount of work they contributed to the probability of finding a block``


23.[Digital Signature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signature)
``A digital signature is a mathematical scheme for verifying the authenticity of digital messages or documents``

24.[Hash](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hash.asp)

``an unspent transaction output (UTXO) represents some amount of digital currency which has been authorized by one account to be spent by another``

26.BIP

``Bitcoin Improvement Proposals are design documents providing information to the Bitcoin community, or describing a new feature for Bitcoin or its processes or environment.``

27.Confirmations

``Once a transaction is included in a block, it has “one confirmation”. As soon as another block is mined on the same blockchain, the transaction has two confirmations etc. Six or more confirmations is considered sufficient proof that a transaction cannot be reversed.``

28.[Hard Forks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#Blocks)

``a rule change such that the software validating according to the old rules will see the blocks produced according to the new rules as invalid``

29.[Decentralization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#Blocks)

``By storing data across its peer-to-peer network, the blockchain eliminates a number of risks that come with data being held centrally.``

30.Difficulty

``A network-wide setting that controls how much computation is required to find a proof-of-work.``

31.Difficulty Target

``A difficulty at which all the computation in the network will find blocks approximately every 10 minutes.``

32.Difficulty Retargeting

``A network-wide re-calculation of the difficulty which occurs once every 2106 blocks and considers the hashing power of the previous 2106 blocks.``

33.P2P Network

``In peer-to-peer (P2P) networking, a group of computers are linked together with equal permissions and responsibilities for processing data.``

37.[POS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_stake)

``Proof-of-stake (PoS) protocols are a class of consensus mechanisms for blockchains that work by selecting validators in proportion to their quantity of holdings in the associated cryptocurrency.``

48.Nonce
``The number used as a variable in such a scenario is called a nonce. The nonce is used to vary the output of a cryptographic function, in this case to vary the SHA-256 fingerprint of the phrase.``
