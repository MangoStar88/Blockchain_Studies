## Core Technologies & Questions

1.[The Byzantine General's Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault)

``a condition of a computer system, particularly distributed computing systems, where components may fail and there is imperfect information on whether a component has failed``

2.[PBFT](https://pmg.csail.mit.edu/papers/osdi99.pdf)

``Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance is a consensus algorithm introduced in the late 90s by Barbara Liskov and Miguel Castro. pBFT was designed to work efficiently in asynchronous(no upper bound on when the response to the request will be received) systems.``

3.[BFT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault)

``is the resiliency of a fault-tolerant computer system to such conditions``

4.[SHA256](https://xorbin.com/tools/sha256-hash-calculator)

``SHA-2 (Secure Hash Algorithm 2) is a set of cryptographic hash functions designed by the United States National Security Agency (NSA) and first published in 2001. They are built using the Merkle–Damgård construction, from a one-way compression function itself built using the Davies–Meyer structure from a specialized block cipher``

The SHA (Secure Hash Algorithm) is one of a number of cryptographic hash functions. A cryptographic hash is like a signature for a data set. If you would like to compare two sets of raw data (source of the file, text or similar) it is always better to hash it and compare SHA256 values. It is like the fingerprints of the data. Even if only one symbol is changed the algorithm will produce different hash value. SHA256 algorithm generates an almost-unique, fixed size 256-bit (32-byte) hash. Hash is so called a one way function. This makes it suitable for checking integrity of your data, challenge hash authentication, anti-tamper, digital signatures, blockchain.

5.[UTXO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unspent_transaction_output)

``In cryptocurrencies, an unspent transaction output (UTXO) represents some amount of digital currency which has been authorized by one account to be spent by another``

6.[SPV-Simplified Payment Verification](https://wiki.bitcoinsv.io/index.php/Simplified_Payment_Verification)

``Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) is described in section 8 of the Bitcoin whitepaper. It allows a transaction recipient to prove that the sender has control of the source funds of the payment they are offering without downloading the full Blockchain, by utilising the properties of Merkle proofs.``

7.[Merkle Path](https://wiki.bitcoinsv.io/index.php/Merkle_path)

``The path of values that connects a leaf node to the Merkle root.``

8.[Merkle Tree/Binary Hash Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree) 

``In cryptography and computer science, a hash tree or Merkle tree is a tree in which every "leaf" (node) is labelled with the cryptographic hash of a data block, and every node that is not a leaf (called a branch, inner node, or inode) is labelled with the cryptographic hash of the labels of its child nodes. ``

9.[Bloom Filters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom_filter)

``A Bloom filter is a space-efficient probabilistic data structure, conceived by Burton Howard Bloom in 1970, that is used to test whether an element is a member of a set``

10.[Balance Binary Tree](https://www.programiz.com/dsa/balanced-binary-tree)

``A balanced binary tree, also referred to as a height-balanced binary tree, is defined as a binary tree in which the height of the left and right subtree of any node differ by not more than 1``
