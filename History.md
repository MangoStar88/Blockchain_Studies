The Early stage
(1991-2008)

Many people would like to call the period from 1991 to 2008 in the early stage of blockchain development. It is worth mentioning that during this period, Stuart Haber and W.Scott Stornetta conceived the concept of BLOCKCHAIN. Their first work involved developing a cryptographically secure blockchain so that no one could tamper with the timestamps of documents. In 1992 they upgraded the system to incorporate Merkle Trees, which improved efficiency.
2008 was a landmark and representative year for the blockchain. This year, a man named Satoshi Nakamoto published a white paper called "Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System". It has become a ‘Bible’ for anyone entering the industry now. In the whitepaper, he explained in detail the achievability of the technology of decentralization. Later, Satoshi Nakamoto withdrew from the blockchain world. No one knew where he went, but blockchain technology did not stagnate because of his departure. On the contrary, the market value of BTC continued to rise in fluctuations.

Blockchain 1.0 
(2008-2013)

The emergence of Bitcoin has allowed the technology of blockchain to be widely disseminated and studied. A peer-to-peer system attracts people like a new planet where people can link to each other, spread information, and govern the community themselves.

Blockchain2.0 
(2013-2015)

In 2013, Russian programmer Vitalik Buterin proposed a new solution, POS consensus, for the limitations of POW consensus, which is also the origin of Ethereum. Vitalik believes that blockchain can also be more malleable and can be used to perform various functions. Ethereum was officially launched in 2015, and it has developed into one of the largest applications of blockchain technology so far.
The biggest feature of Ethereum is that it can support smart contracts and decentralized applications. Although there is some unpleasantness due to development problems and the community in 2022, this will not stop the pace of blockchain technology.

Blockchain 3.0 
(2018～now)

More and more projects have emerged in recent years, and they are working to solve some of the shortcomings of Bitcoin and Ethereum. More and more large companies are investing heavily in blockchain projects, including Wall Street. Although there are still many people like Buffett who hold conservative views on Cryptocurrencies, blockchain technology will continue to grow with the industry as the stars shine.
